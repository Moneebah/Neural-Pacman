# Neural-Pacman
Development and training of Pacman and its ghosts for gameplay - currently under progress.

# Interface
![pacman](https://github.com/Moneebah/Neural-Pacman/assets/129015993/7c129df1-f892-4e47-abd9-693a0af640d7)

# Objective
You have to collect all the coins without getting caught by the enemies. Each time you collect a coin, your score goes up by one. Collect all the coins to win the game and get high scores along the way. Note that if you get caught by a ghost/enemy you will lose 10 points! You will also lose a life. You only have 3 tries to make a high score after that, GAME OVER!

# IN-PROGRESS
The game has been built using pygame library, you can control pacman using arrow keys.
Neural network will soon be implemented. Ghosts are set on a fixed path for now
